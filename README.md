# GatoBot (First Python Script)
Pretty self explanatory, This is the first thing I coded. This is the first project that inspired me to be where I am now. My first true expirenece coding was quite exciting. I remeber at 2am in the morning, looking through youtube. When something caught my eye. discord bot for free host on repl.it! Previously I've had chances to touch onto Computer Science, but never had it Previously clicked like it did here. I remeber telling my paraents the next day how proud I was that i wrote 100 lines in 1 day! Anyways, You can take a look at my old code and see the difference with what I write now.
